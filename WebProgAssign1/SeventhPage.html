      <h1 class="w3-center">Stan Lee</h1>
      <p>Stan Lee (born Stanley Martin Lieber) was an American writer, editor, creator of comic book superheroes, and the former president and chairman of Marvel Comics.
        With several artist co-creators, most notably Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, he co-created Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, Thor as a superhero, the X-Men, Iron Man,
        the Hulk, Daredevil, the Silver Surfer, Dr. Strange, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Scarlet Witch, The Inhumans, and many other characters, introducing complex, naturalistic characters and a thoroughly shared universe into superhero comic books.
        He subsequently led the expansion of Marvel Comics from a small division of a publishing house to a large multimedia corporation.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-center">Jack Kirby</h1>
      <p>Few illustrators in the history of comic books have had as much influence as Jack Kirby. He laid the groundwork for the Marvel Universe, and The Avengers were identified by his peculiar writing style from the very first issue in 1963.
        The book was an instant hit thanks to his strong, bold lines and special ability to depict expansive splash pages and action scenes. Additionally, it produced an enormous canvas on which gods and creatures like Thor and the Hulk could operate;
        eventually, this canvas grew to encompass the entirety of comicsâ€™ cosmos. The Avengers were forever characterized by Kirby.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-center">George Perez</h1>
      <p>George Perez is one of the best writers/artists in the history of comics. He spent most of the '80s working for DC but returned to Marvel in the early '90s, turning in work on Infinity Gauntlet, leaving the book after drawing part of issue four, and The Incredible Hulk: Future Imperfect.
        In 1998, he and writer Kurt Busiek relaunched Avengers and made it one of the best team books on the market. In 2003, he and Busiek worked together on JLA/Avengers, the biggest crossover between Marvel and DC.
        Perez's effect on the comic industry is undeniable. Many artists got into comics because of him and his work. He's a fantastic artist, and his level of detail, eye for design, character acting, page layout skills, and action penciling are second to none.</p>
